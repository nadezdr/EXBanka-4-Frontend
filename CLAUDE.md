# EXBanka-4-Frontend

## Project overview
Client-facing and employee banking portal built with React + Vite + Tailwind CSS. Two separate portals share the same codebase:
- **Employee portal** — `/` and `/admin/*` routes, protected by JWT auth
- **Client portal** — `/client/*` routes, protected by client auth context

## Stack
- React 18, React Router v6
- Tailwind CSS v3 with custom utility classes (`input-field`, `btn-primary`, `input-error`) defined in `src/index.css`
- Axios for API calls — two instances: `src/services/apiClient.js` (employee) and `src/services/clientApiClient.js` (client)
- Vite dev server

## How to run the app
The full stack is started via the **EXBanka-4-Infrastructure** repo using Docker Compose:
```bash
# from EXBanka-4-Infrastructure/
docker compose up        # start everything (builds images on first run)
docker compose up -d     # start in background
docker compose up --build frontend  # rebuild frontend after code changes
```
The app is accessed at **http://localhost:3000** (nginx serves the built React app).

The `npm run dev` commands below are for standalone frontend development only (Vite dev server at http://localhost:5173), not the integrated stack.

## Commands
```bash
npm run dev      # standalone dev server at http://localhost:5173 (not the full stack)
npm run build    # production build
npm run preview  # preview production build
```

## Architecture notes

### Auth
- **Employee auth**: `POST /login` → `{ access_token, refresh_token }` stored in **sessionStorage**. JWT decoded client-side (no signature verification) for claims: `user_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `dozvole` (permissions). Session restored on app mount via `authService.restoreSession()`. Also implements activate (`POST /auth/activate`), forgot-password, and reset-password flows.
- **Client auth**: `POST /client/login` → tokens stored in sessionStorage under `client_access_token` / `client_refresh_token`. Managed by `clientAuthService` + `clientTokenService`. Claims: `user_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`.
- Both `AuthContext` and `ClientAuthContext` listen for session-expired custom events to trigger forced logout.

### API clients
Both Axios instances (`apiClient.js` and `clientApiClient.js`) share the same pattern:
- Base URL from `VITE_API_URL` env var, defaults to `http://localhost:8083`
- **Request interceptor**: attaches `Authorization: Bearer <token>` from sessionStorage
- **Response interceptor**:
  - On 401: silently refreshes token (`POST /refresh` or `POST /client/refresh`), queues concurrent requests during refresh, retries after success
  - On final 401 failure: dispatches `auth:session-expired` / `client-auth:session-expired` custom event → forced logout
  - On 4xx/5xx: dispatches `api:error` custom event with user-friendly message → picked up by `ApiErrorContext` → toast

### Error handling
- `ApiErrorContext` / `ApiErrorProvider` — global toast notification system
- Listens for `api:error` events dispatched by the Axios interceptors
- Toasts auto-dismiss after 5 s, rendered bottom-right
- Use `addToast(message)` / `addSuccess(message)` from `useApiError()` hook for manual toasts

### State management
React Context only — no Redux, Zustand, or TanStack Query. Ten context providers:
1. `AuthContext` — employee session
2. `ClientAuthContext` — client session
3. `ClientAccountsContext` — client's bank accounts, exposes `reload()` and `renameAccount()`
4. `ClientPaymentsContext` — client's payments, exposes `reload()`
5. `RecipientsContext` — full CRUD + reorder for payment recipients
6. `AccountsContext` — employee view of all bank accounts
7. `EmployeesContext` — employee management
8. `ClientsContext` — client management
9. `ThemeContext` — dark mode toggle, persisted in localStorage, syncs with OS preference on first load
10. `ApiErrorContext` — global toast system (see above)

### Data fetching
Services are thin Axios wrappers that return model instances via `*FromApi()` mappers. Context providers call service functions on auth state changes and store results in state. Use the context's `reload()` after any mutation to keep all pages in sync.

### Client portal layout
All logged-in client pages (except `ClientHomePage` which doubles as a landing page) use `<ClientPortalLayout>` which provides the sidebar and navbar. `NAV_ITEMS` is exported from `ClientPortalLayout.jsx` and shared with `ClientHomePage`.

### Shared utilities
- `src/utils/formatting.js` — `fmt(n, currency?)` for Serbian-locale number formatting
- `src/utils/permissions.js` — permission definitions; `permissionsFromDozvole()` in Employee model maps backend `dozvole` list to permissions object

### Styling conventions
- Use existing Tailwind classes — avoid inline styles except for dynamic values (e.g. `gridTemplateAreas`)
- `input-field` — standard text/select/date input
- `input-error` — red border variant applied alongside `input-field`
- `btn-primary` — violet filled button

## Current status
Backend fully integrated — all data is fetched from the live Go backend. Mock files in `src/mocks/` are legacy artifacts not imported anywhere and can be deleted.

### Employee portal pages
Employee list, detail, create — client list, detail, create — account list, detail, create — bank accounts view — loan applications (approve/reject) — loans overview — securities/listings list (`/securities`) — listing detail (`/securities/:id`) — auth pages (login, forgot password, set/reset password) — dashboard — about.
